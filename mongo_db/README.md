# MongoDB assignment
This folder contains the script used to split the original dataset for the second assignment into the requested document structure for MongoDB. 
The code can be found in [json_processer_final.py](./mongo_db/dataset_pre_processing/json_processer_final.py), whereas the other two folder contain,
respectively, the input and output data.
